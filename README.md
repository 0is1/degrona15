#### Script Folder Strucutre (from FoundationPress)

* bower_components/: This is the source folder where all Foundation scripts are located. foundation update will check and update scripts in this folder
* js/custom: This is where you put all your custom scripts. Every .js file you put in this directory will be minified and concatinated to app.js
* js/: jQuery, Modernizr and Foundation scripts are copied from bower_components/ to this directory, where they are minified and concatinated and enqueued in WordPress
* Please note that you must run grunt in your terminal for the scripts to be copied. See Gruntfile.js for details
